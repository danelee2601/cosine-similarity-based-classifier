# Introduction
PyTorch implementation of the cosine similarity-based classifier from [1]. 
`cos_sim_clf.py` includes the implementation of the classifier for 1d data like time series.

This implementation was designed to address time series data, however, it should be straightfoward to convert it to 2 dimensiaonl data if needed.
